# Generative Adversarial Network Application for Cartographic Heritage Translation to Satellite Images of Java Island, Indonesia

![Project Logo](link_to_logo.png)

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and resources for the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) application designed for translating cartographic heritage maps of Java Island, Indonesia, into satellite images. The project aims to bridge the gap between historical cartographic representations and modern satellite imagery.

## Features
- **GAN Model:** The core of the project consists of a GAN model trained on a dataset of historical maps and corresponding satellite images.
- **Dataset:** Details about the dataset used for training the model.
- **Preprocessing:** Code and steps involved in preprocessing the data for model training.
- **Results:** Showcase of results, comparisons between input maps and generated satellite images.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the GAN model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Generate satellite images from cartographic maps:
   ```bash
   python generate_images.py --input_path path/to/cartographic/map.jpg
   ```
